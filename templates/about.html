          <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            The yt project aims to produce an integrated science environment for
            collaboratively asking and answering astrophysical questions. To do
            so, it will encompass the creation of initial conditions, the
            execution of simulations, and the detailed exploration and
            visualization of the resultant data. It will also provide a standard
            framework based on physical quantities interoperability between codes.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Development of yt is driven by a commitment to Open Science principles
            as manifested in participatory development, reproducibility,
            documented and approachable code, a friendly and helpful community of
            users and developers, and Free and Libre Open Source Software.

          expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines
          when interacting with others both inside and outside of our
          community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive,
          successful, and growing community.</p>

                variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to
                enrich our community. In particular, discussions
                relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
                programming languages, and so on are welcome, but
                these should be done with respect, taking proactive

              violations of the code of conduct. We will take action
              when members of our community violate this code such as
