          <p>The first yt developers workshop will be held at UC Santa Cruz
          from March 6-8. While the lion's share of time will be spent on
	  code sprints, we will also include sessions on best practices for
	  day-to-day development, planning for the future, and the upcoming
	  yt 3.0 release.</p>
          <p>This website will include workshop details, recordings of the
          talk and summaries of the breakout groups.</p>
          <p>The yt developer's workshop is supported by a UC-HIPACC grant.</p>

                    <p>The workshop will be held in the Interdisciplinary Sciences 
		      Building (ISB) at UC Santa Cruz. ISB is accessible by city bus

		      If possible, we suggest flying into San Jose International 
		      airport (SJC) rather than San Francisco International (SFO)
		      or Oakland (OAK) as SJC is about 30 miles closer to Santa Cruz.
		    </p>
                    <p>
		      Getting from the airport to Santa Cruz can be tricky via public
		      transportation, as detailed on 
		      <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/airportpublictrans.html">
			this UCSC information page</a>. If possible, it may be worthwhile
		      to rent a car for your stay in Santa Cruz. The organizing committee 
		      wil attempt to organize group shuttles or airport pickups if that is 
		      logistically possible.

		      We've reserved a block of 10 double-occopancy rooms at the
		      <a href="http://mission-inn.com/">Mission Inn</a>.  If you'd like
		      to stay there, you'll need to call and reserve one of the rooms in
		      our block.  The reservation is under 'Nathan Goldbaum'.  The room
		      is $100.45 per night, including tax.  We expect most attendees to
		      double up so please try to find a roommate before reserving the room.
		      If you'd prefer a single-occopancy room, feel free to contact the 
		      workshop organizers at 
		      <tt><a href="mailto:workshop2013@yt-project.org">workshop2013@yt-project.org</a></tt>.

		      The Mission Inn is about <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/7glcl">1/2 mile from the nearest bus stop</a>
		      to campus at the intersection of Bay & Mission.  This stop is 
		      served by <a href="http://www.scmtd.com/">Santa Cruz Metro</a> 
		      routes 15, 16, and 19.  The workshop venue is close to the Science Hill
		      and Health Center bus stops on campus.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      If you'd prefer to organize your own hotel room, UCSC has agreements 
		      with several area hotels to obtain discounted rates. A list of hotels 
		      <a href="http://cruzbuy.ucsc.edu/howto/hotelagreements.html">is available</a>
		      on the UCSC business website. It's a bit of a walk from the Mission Inn 
		      to the nearest bus stop at the intersection of Bay Street and Mission 
		      so it may be worthwhile to look for a hotel that is a bit closer to 
		      downtown Santa Cruz and the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/Gj0Ky">bus station</a>.

			Much of the time at the workshop will be spent in small breakout
			groups. Each group will work on a single new feature, enhancement, or
			mini-project with the goal of completing the project or at least 
			making significant progress before the end of the workshop.
		      </p>
		      <p>
			Breakout group topics will be drawn from entries in our 
			<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/issues?status=new&status=open">issue tracker</a>
			and suggestions mentioned by participants during registration.
			We expect our participants to have a broad range in familiarity with
			yt, python, and scientific programming and will plan project topics accordingly.

			The workshop will begin at 9:30 AM with a reception including coffee 
			and refreshments in the CfAO atrium.  Once our room becomes available
			at 10:00 AM, we will move over to ISB 102, where we will remain for the
			rest of the workshop.  The room has a projector, WiFi, and tables and
			chairs that can be easily moved around for optimal collaboration.  The
			official program will end at 5:00 PM each day, however we will not be
			kicked out of the room and it will be possible to continue working
			as late as needed.

			While most of our time will be spent on campus at UC Santa Cruz, there will
			still be time for socializing in the evenings and the weekend following the
			workshop.  The social hot-spot is downtown Santa Cruz along pacific avenue 
			where there are a number of bars, restaurants, and shops.  Going further afield,
			Santa Cruz is well known for its beaches and surf spots.  The beach boardwalk
			is fun although it can be a bit crowded on the weekends.  There are a number of
			<a href="http://www.thatsmypark.org/parks-beaches/parks-beaches/">state parks in the area</a>, 
			including Henry Cowell Redwoods, Wilder Ranch, Natural Bridges, and Big Basin.
		      </p>
		      <p>
			Depending on overall level of interest, we are planning on organizing a trip to
			see the elephant seals during their mating season at <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=523">Año nuevo state park</a>, 
			north of Santa Cruz along Highway 1 close to Half-moon bay.  If you're interested in coming,
			please let us know on your registration form.
