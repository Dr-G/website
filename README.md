# The yt website repository

This repository includes the yt website.  Some things, including the gallery
and contributors, are autogenerated.

To add a new image to the gallery, add it to the img/gallery directory and then
add it to gallery.yaml at the top.

To add a new member, add to members.yaml.

To generate the website, run generate.py.  This requires a yt to be installed
from its mercurial repository directory, and it additionally requires hglib,
pyyaml and jinja2 to be installed.
